DATA ENGINEERING END-TO-END YOUTUBE TRENDING ANALYSIS

STEP 1 - ANALYSING DATA

I downloaded the dataset from kaggle and i first analysed the dataset. The folder contained .JSON files and also .csv files. Before working with the data, i first had to analyse and see how the data is.
The csv files had no problems other than encoding which i solved by resaving it as UFT-8 encoding. As for the .JSON files their formatting had problems
